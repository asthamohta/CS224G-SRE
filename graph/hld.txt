# RootScout: High-Level Design (HLD) & Intuition

## 1. The Core Intuition: "The Detective & The Blueprint"

To understand RootScout, think of a large office building where a fire alarm goes off.



* **The Problem:** The alarm is ringing, but the building has 50 different rooms.
* **The "Old" Way:** A detective (the AI) runs into every single room to look for smoke. This is slow, expensive, and the detective often gets confused (hallucinations).
* **The RootScout Way:**
    1.  **The Blueprint (The Graph):** Before entering, the detective looks at the building's blueprint. It shows the alarm was triggered in the "Kitchen," but the gas pipe feeding the Kitchen comes from the "Basement."
    2.  **The Investigation (The Agent):** The detective ignores the Bedrooms and the Attic. They go straight to the **Basement** to check the pipes.
